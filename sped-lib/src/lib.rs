                we know that the best forward chain starting at from is from-fwd.
                but it is possible that there is an alternative chaining arriving
                at fwd that is better, such that alt-fwd is to be preferred to
                from-fwd. an analogous situation is possible in backward chaining,
                where an alternative link bck-alt may be better than bck-from.

                before making the new link, check if fwd/bck are already chained,
                and in such case compare the scores of the proposed chaining to
                the existing one, and keep only the best of the two.

                there is an undesirable aspect of this procedure: the result may
                depend on the order of exploration. consider the following
                configuration:

                a x-------x b
                /
                /
                c x---x d    with score(a-b) < score(c-b) < score(c-d)
                or equivalently ||a-b|| > ||b-c|| > ||c-d||

                let us consider two possible orders of exploration.

                order: a,b,c
                we will first chain a-b when exploring a. when analyzing the
                backward links of b, we will prefer c-b, and a-b will be unlinked.
                finally, when exploring c, c-d will be preferred and c-b will be
                unlinked. the result is just the chaining c-d.

                order: c,b,a
                we will first chain c-d when exploring c. then, when exploring
                the backward connections of b, c-b will be the preferred link;
                but because c-d exists already and has a better score, c-b
                cannot be linked. finally, when exploring a, the link a-b will
                be created because there is no better backward linking of b.
                the result is two chainings: c-d and a-b.

                we did not found yet a simple algorithm to solve this problem. by
                simple, we mean an algorithm without two passes or the need to
                re-evaluate the chaining of points where one link is cut.

                for most edge points, there is only one possible chaining and this
                problem does not arise. but it does happen and a better solution
                is desirable.

    there cannot be more than X*Y edge points to be put in the output list:
    edge points must be local maxima of gradient modulus, so at most half of
    the pixels could be so. when a closed curve is found, one edge point will
    be put twice to the output. even if all possible edge points (half of the
    pixels in the image) would form one pixel closed curves (which is not
    possible) that would lead to output X*Y edge points.

    for the same reason, there cannot be more than X*Y curves: the worst case
    is when all possible edge points (half of the pixels in the image) would
    form one pixel chains. in that case (which is not possible) one would need
    a size for curve_limits of X*Y/2+1. so X*Y is enough.

    (curve_limits requires one more item than the number of curves.
    a simplest example is when only one chain of length 3 is present:
    curve_limits[0] = 0, curve_limits[1] = 3.)
